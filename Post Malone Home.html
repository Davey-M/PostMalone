                Austin Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Rich Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the popular video game Guitar Hero.

                Malone has always had a love for emo music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles in June 2017, playing songs by American emo band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. Soon after, he says he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.
